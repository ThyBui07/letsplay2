Step-by-Step Task List for LETSPLAY CRUD API Development
1. Database Design
Set Up MongoDB: Install MongoDB and set up the database server.
Design User Schema:
Create a User schema with fields: id, name, email, password, and role.
Design Product Schema:
Create a Product schema with fields: id, name, description, price, and userId.
Establish Relationships:
Define the relationship where a single User can own multiple Products.
2. API Development Setup
Initialize Spring Boot Project:
Use Spring Initializr to set up your Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies (Spring Web, Spring Data MongoDB).
Configure MongoDB:
Set up MongoDB connection details in application.properties.
3. Develop RESTful APIs
User APIs:
Implement CRUD operations for Users (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
Product APIs:
Implement CRUD operations for Products.
Adhere to REST Standards:
Ensure all APIs follow RESTful principles.
Public GET Products API:
Make the "GET Products" API accessible without authentication.
4. Authentication & Authorization
Implement Token-Based Authentication:
Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or a similar approach for authentication.
Secure API Access:
Restrict access to APIs for authenticated users, except for the "GET Products" API.
Role-Based Access Control:
Implement different access levels (e.g., admin, user).
5. Error Handling
Prevent 5XX Errors:
Ensure robust error handling to prevent server errors.
Custom Error Responses:
Implement custom error messages and HTTP status codes.
6. Security Measures
Secure Password Storage:
Hash and salt user passwords before storing them in the database.
Input Validation:
Implement validation to prevent MongoDB injection attacks.
Protect Sensitive Data:
Avoid returning sensitive user information in API responses.
Implement HTTPS:
Use HTTPS to secure data in transit.
7. Bonus Challenges (Optional)
Set CORS Policies:
Configure appropriate CORS settings for cross-origin resource sharing.
Implement Rate Limiting:
Add rate limiting to protect against brute force attacks.
8. Testing
API Testing:
Conduct tests to ensure API correctness.
Authentication & Authorization Testing:
Test authentication mechanisms and role-based access.
Security Testing:
Validate the implementation of security measures.
9. Project Audit Preparation
Code Review:
Perform a thorough code review for quality and adherence to project requirements.
Documentation:
Ensure all code is well-documented and easy to understand.
10. Deployment (Optional)
Prepare for Deployment:
Consider containerization with Docker for easy deployment.
Deploy the Application:
Choose a cloud platform or server for deployment.
